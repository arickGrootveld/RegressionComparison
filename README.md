# RegressionComparison
Code to generate a random (polynomial) target function, and then perform regression analysis on that target function

This code is a project that I worked on to add some additional content to a class I am currently taking at Syracuse University (ELE 791, Statistical Learning Theory).

It was created as a way to simulate Figure 4.1 from [1] (page 121).
